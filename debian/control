Description: a Git patch queue manager
 TopGit manages a patch queue using Git topic branches, one patch per
 branch. It allows for patch dependencies and can thus manage
 non-linear patch series.
 .
 TopGit is a minimal layer on top of Git, which does not limit use of
 Git's functionality (such as the index). It rigorously keeps history
 until a patch is accepted upstream. It is also fully usable across
 distributed repositories.
